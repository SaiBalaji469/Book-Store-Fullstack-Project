# Bookstore Web Application (MERN Stack)

## Overview

This project is a **Bookstore Web Application** built using the **MERN** stack, consisting of **MongoDB**, **Express.js**, **React**, and **Node.js**. The application allows users to browse books, manage their shopping carts, and place orders. It also features an **Admin Dashboard** for managing the inventory, adding new books, updating details, and deleting products.

The application is designed with the following key features and functionalities:

- **Frontend:** Built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a clean and responsive UI.
- **State Management:** Leveraging **Redux** and **RTK Query Toolkit** to manage state and efficiently handle data fetching.
- **Backend:** Using **Node.js** with **Express.js** for creating the server and handling routes, authentication, and business logic.
- **Database:** **MongoDB** is used to store product data, user information, and orders.
- **Authentication:** **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** is implemented for user and admin authentication.
- **Inventory Management System:** Admins can manage the entire book inventory, including adding, updating, and deleting books.

## Key Features

### 1. **User Side (Frontend)**

- **Browse Books:** Users can view a catalog of books, sorted by categories and genres.
- **Shopping Cart:** Users can add or remove books from their shopping cart.
- **Checkout System:** The app supports a **Cash on Delivery** (COD) system. Users can proceed to checkout, where they can provide their details for order fulfillment.
- **Order Placement:** Users can place orders, which are stored in the database with relevant details like order items and user information.

### 2. **Admin Dashboard (Backend)**

- **Admin Authentication:** Admins can log in to the admin panel using a secure username and password. JWT tokens are used to ensure secure authentication.

  - **Update Books:** Admins can edit existing book details.
  - **Delete Books:** Admins can remove books from the inventory if needed.
- **Inventory Management:** Admins have full control over the inventory, ensuring that the book data is always up-to-date.

### 3. **State Management with Redux and RTK Query**

- **Redux** is used to manage global state throughout the application, making it easy to track the user's cart and orders.
- **RTK Query Toolkit** simplifies data fetching and reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed for API calls. It helps manage server-side interactions such as fetching book data and submitting orders.

### 4. **Responsive Design**

- The user interface is fully responsive, allowing users to access the bookstore from desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. **Tailwind CSS** is used for quick styling and ensuring a clean and modern design.
